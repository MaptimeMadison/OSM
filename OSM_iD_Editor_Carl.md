#Adding to OpenStreetMap with iD Editor
##Presented by: Carl Sack  
1. Sign up/Log in
2. OSM Interface - navigation tools and layers
	- Zoom to Madison
3. OSM data structure
	- Open http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features
	- Each mapped feature gets a Tag (format: key=value):
		- Key: categories
		- Value: types
	- Relation: if the feature is related to or part of other features
	- Element: geometry point/line/polygon
		- In OSM lingo, “nodes” and “ways”; polygons are “closed ways”
	- Describes the feature--**important to match feature attributes to this description (e.g. roads, buildings)**  
	- Rendering: how the feature is symbolized on the main OSM basemap
	- Photo: these are examples only; **rely on the comments and individual wiki pages for each Tag**  
	- Look at feature examples in Madison
How to [download the data](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm)		- Comes in the form of .osm or shapefiles for GIS software
4. Let’s Edit!
	- Observe building footprints in Willy Street and Isthmus area--they peter out east of Webster and north of Wilson.
	- Click “Edit” and zoom in on this area until editor interface appears
	- Examine different base layers--notice different registration errors for different satellite imagery tiles; choose most consistent with surrounding features
	- Demo drawing a polygon and labeling it
	- Demo editing a feature
	- Other ways to edit: GPS and Walking Papers--I won’t demo these, but more info is available at [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_techniques](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapping_techniques) 
5. Assignment and play time!
	- Assignment: Read [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)
	- Pick an area to map and write it on the board to ensure no overlap. Then go!
